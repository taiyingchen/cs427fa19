Instruction
============
List at least 1 code smell for each question.
List at least 1 code example for each code smell.
Explain the code smell in each example with 1 or 2 sentences. 
(e.g. the process of ... appears 2 times in ... method.)

Answer to Q1
============
We found the following code smell(s): Duplicated Code, Long Method

Here are some example(s) of each code smell: 

Name: Duplicated Code

Example 1: The method printLogging can be extracted from multiple copies of code that prints the current node information and that it passed the packet onward.
Code: 
	try {
		report.write("\tNode '");
		report.write(currentNode.name);
		report.write("' passes packet on.\n");
		report.flush();
	} catch (IOException exc) {
		// just ignore
	}

Example 2: The method printAccounting can be extracted from multiple copies of code that prints the accounting information.
Code: 
	report.write("\tAccounting -- author = '");
	report.write(author);
	report.write("' -- title = '");
	report.write(title);
	report.write("'\n");
	report.write(str4);
	report.flush();

Example 3: The method printNodeType can be extracted from multiple copies of code that prints the current node's information using a switch case based on the type.
Code: 
	switch (currentNode.type) {
	case Node.NODE:
		buf.append("Node ");
		buf.append(currentNode.name);
		buf.append(" [Node]");
		break;
	case Node.WORKSTATION:
		buf.append("Workstation ");
		buf.append(currentNode.name);
		buf.append(" [Workstation]");
		break;
	case Node.PRINTER:
		buf.append("Printer ");
		buf.append(currentNode.name);
		buf.append(" [Printer]");
		break;
	default:
		buf.append("(Unexpected)");
		break;
	}
	
Name: Long Method

Example 1: The method checkDestination can be extracted from requestWorkstationPrintsDocument to reduce it's lengthiness. requestWorkstationPrintsDocument can now just return the result given from the checkDestination method. 
Code: 
	boolean result;
	if (packet.destination.equals(currentNode.name)) {
		result = printDocument(currentNode, packet, report);
	} else {
		try {
			report.write(">>> Destination not found, print job canceled.\n\n");
			report.flush();
		} catch (IOException exc) {
			// just ignore
		}

		result = false;
	}

	return result;
